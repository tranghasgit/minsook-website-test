        <h2>The Christmas Tree Project, 2021.</h2>
        <p>The Promise of Ruin(s) tackles the concept of ruin(s)—as both a material relic and an intangible construct of the mind—into their diverse specificity, giving space to relational proposals and overlapping temporalities. Each of the three upcoming chapters echoes the ruin in its multiplicity, from the reading of modernity, to the speculative discrepancy of decay and precariousness of turbo-capitalism.
          This program is set to unfold at The Balcony over the course of the upcoming year. Each chapter is articulated as a trio exhibition. The aim is to bind established artists, with mid-career and recently graduated practitioners from the field.

          About this sketch:
        </p>
        <p>
          So I made a custom map with scattered elements. Each element is one of your project and they can expand infinitely (as many projects as you want). You can choose whatever cordinates you like.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can embed videos or text as you wish for each object on the map. (Please click <span class="cTrigger4 thisToSee">this</span> to see).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="thisTxtbox">This part</span> of the map doesn't have to contain this text but I was thinking it could contain what you are working on atm. It will also not contain this ugly notation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing to explore is the menu (only the "Works"), try it out! The coordinates are not entirely correct but idea is to move to the coressponding object when the project is clicked in the menu.
